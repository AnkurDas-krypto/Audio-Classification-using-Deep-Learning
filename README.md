For extracting features we have used Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC). The MFCC summarises the frequency distribution across 
the window size, so it is possible to analyse both the frequency and time characteristics of the sound. 

Used Label Encoder for the categorical values and used ANN for training the mmodel. 

Getting accuracy of about 78%.
